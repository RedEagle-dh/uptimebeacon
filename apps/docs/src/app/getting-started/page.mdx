## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Performance Optimization

- **Group similar monitors**: Use tags to organize
- **Stagger check intervals**: Avoid checking everything at once
- **Use appropriate timeouts**: Not too short, not too long

### Alert Fatigue Prevention

- **Set up retries**: Avoid false positives
- **Use escalation**: Start with warnings before critical alerts
- **Batch notifications**: Group multiple alerts when appropriate

### Team Collaboration

- **Define on-call schedule**: Who gets notified when
- **Document runbooks**: Link to resolution guides in monitors
- **Review incidents**: Learn from downtime events

## ❓ Common Questions

<details>
<summary>How often can I check my monitors?</summary>

Minimum interval is 30 seconds. For most use cases, 1-5 minutes is recommended to balance accuracy with resource usage.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I monitor services behind a firewall?</summary>

UptimeBeacon needs internet access to your services. For internal monitoring, you can:
- Expose a health check endpoint
- Use VPN or tunneling (Tailscale, Cloudflare Tunnel)
- Deploy UptimeBeacon inside your network

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when a monitor goes down?</summary>

1. UptimeBeacon performs retry checks (configurable)
2. If still down, creates an incident
3. Sends notifications to configured channels
4. Updates status page
5. Continues monitoring until service recovers
6. Closes incident and sends recovery notification

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I monitor APIs with authentication?</summary>

Use custom headers in HTTP monitors:

```
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I get notified only during business hours?</summary>

Not currently supported, but on the roadmap! You can:
- Use different notification channels for different times
- Set up a webhook that filters by time
- Configure monitoring intervals differently
